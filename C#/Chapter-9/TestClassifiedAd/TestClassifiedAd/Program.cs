    Create an application named TestClassifiedAd that instantiates and displays at least
    two ClassifiedAd objects. A ClassifiedAd has fields for a category (for example,
    Used Cars), a number of words, and a price. Include properties that contain get and
    set accessors for the category and number of words, but only a get accessor for the
    price. The price is calculated at nine cents per word.
