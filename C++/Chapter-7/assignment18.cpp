/*
Create a program that displays the weekly gross pay for any number of employees. The 
user will input the number of hours the employee worked and the employeeâ€™s hourly 
rate. Employees working more than 40 hours receive time and one-half for the hours 
worked over 40. If necessary, create a new project named Introductory18 Project, and 
save it in the Cpp8\Chap07 folder. Enter the C++ instructions into a source file named 
Introductory18.cpp. Also enter appropriate comments and any additional instructions 
required by the compiler. Save, run, and test the program.
